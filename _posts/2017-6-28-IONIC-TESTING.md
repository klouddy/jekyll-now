# Setup for Ionic Testing

I like to unit test everything. Which means I need everything I deploy to production to have a test harness.  In the case of an Ionic app because it is still just an Angular app I can follow the example from the `angular cli` and use `TestBed` with `Karma` it gives me all I need.  I did find that it is still quite annoying to add it into an ionic app, however. So I wrote this to keep track of the setup.
